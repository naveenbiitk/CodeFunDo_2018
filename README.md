Idea: 

Forest fires cost India â‚¹1100 crore a year [reference](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/3tVM9yC5hRl7kapC2CNgKL/Forest-fires-cost-India-1100-crore-a-year-report.html)

Not only forest fires but also industrial fires, domestic fires etc. cause large problems to us.

Our idea is to alert people about the fire incidents before they spread rapidly and cause widespread damage.
 
We intend to create a program using Image Processing which can detect fire and alert the concerned authorities.
A low-cost monitoring camera or webcam is sufficient to demonstrate the process.
 
 Creativity: 
 
 1.We will detect fire and send its image to the email id's of concerned people.
 
 2.We also plan to create a mobile app , so that if internet connection is not available, we can alert people through phone calls or sms.
 
 3.As this method can sometimes fail by detecting false fire or similar objects , so as a major improvement in our program, we will use deep learning image classification techniques to analyse the right fire images. We also plan to extend our idea by detecting the number of people stuck at the site of accident.
