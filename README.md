Idea: 

Forest fires cost India â‚¹1100 crore a year [a link](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/3tVM9yC5hRl7kapC2CNgKL/Forest-fires-cost-India-1100-crore-a-year-report.html)

Not only Forest fires even Industrial fires,domestic fire incidents are creating a large problems to us.

 Our idea is to alert people from the fire incidents before it makes widespread damages and rapid spread.
 
 We are creating a program using Image Processing which can detect fire and send alert to user.
 A cheap montoring camera or webcam is needed to demonstarte this
 
 Creativity: 
 
 1.We will be detecting fire and send this image to the email id's we already mentioned
 
 2.We are planning to create a mobile app also, as if internet connection is not available we can alert people through phone calls or sms.
 
 3.As this method sometimes can fail by detecting false Fire or similar object like that, So here comes the main part where we will use deep learning image classification techniques to analyse the right thing. We can also extend by detecting number of people stucked there in dangerous spot.
